# Artists Events

The project have been developed using React, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap v3.3.7 to layout, and Redux for state management.
<br>We have used Axios library with promise to call the suggested API, and Webpack to bundle assets.

In the footer of the app contains our team members. Tell us if you have any questions.


The app was configurated on port 3000, but you can change it in "npm start" command.<br>
To start the app in the default port is simple:<br>
npm install<br>
npm start

To start in other port (3005 for example):<br>
PORT 3005 npm start
